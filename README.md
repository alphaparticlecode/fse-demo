Some concepts to explore here:

  - Block styles
  - Block patterns
  - Block variations
  - Simple custom block without ACF
  - Is there good core support for repeaters without ACF yet?
  - Create Block Theme [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/)
  
Heavily inspired by the [Jace](https://wordpress.org/themes/jace/) theme, with lots of learnings and code taken from there.
